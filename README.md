# white_balance_correction

White balance correction is a process used in photography and videography to ensure that colors appear natural and accurate in an image or video. The term "white balance" refers to the adjustment of colors in a way that white objects appear truly white, regardless of the lighting conditions under which the photo or video was taken.

Different light sources, such as sunlight, incandescent bulbs, or fluorescent lights, emit light with varying color temperatures. Without white balance correction, the colors in an image might appear too warm (yellowish) or too cool (bluish), depending on the lighting conditions.

White balance correction involves adjusting the relative intensity of different color channels (red, green, and blue) to neutralize any color cast caused by the lighting. This adjustment ensures that whites and other neutral tones in the image look neutral, improving the overall color accuracy and realism of the photograph or video. Most modern cameras and image editing software provide automatic white balance correction or manual controls for users to make these adjustments.
